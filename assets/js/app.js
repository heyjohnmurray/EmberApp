	MVC basics

	M 	= MODEL	(data like JSON files or database code)	
		= Models manage the data for an application.

	V 	= VIEW 	(user interface code)	
		= Views are a visual representation of models that present a filtered view of their current state. 

	C 	= CONTROLLER
		= Controllers are an intermediary between models and views which are classically responsible 
		for two tasks: they both update the view when the model changes and update the model when the user 
		manipulates the view.

	Templating:

	JavaScript templating solutions (such as Handlebars.js and Mustache) are often used to define templates for views 
	as markup (either stored externally or within script tags with a custom type â€“ e.g text/template) 
	containing template variables.

	MVC flow:

	Model updates View
	View sees User
	User uses Controller
	Controller manipulates Model

	Routes:

	Assist in managing application state (e.g allowing users to bookmark a particular view they have navigated to). 
	Routers are neither a part of MVC nor present in every MVC-like framework.
